# DigitalTwin
a simple digital twin in Unity, simulating a fire scenario to test emergency responses with AI-driven characters.
Creating a simple digital twin in Unity for simulating a fire scenario with AI-driven characters aims to enhance safety, provide cost-effective training, improve emergency response times, and gather valuable data for optimizing emergency plans. This approach leverages the power of virtual simulations to prepare individuals and organizations for real-world emergencies in a safe, controlled, and efficient manner.
